To plug your service to our platofmr you need to define howe we can communicate
with it. We are expecting a few endpoints to be present on your side, they are
detailed in this page.

Provisioning consists in allocating what your service is providing. For
instance, a Database as a Service would create and initialize the database and
return the correct credentials. The user should be able to use the addon almost
instantly.
